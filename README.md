#JQuery Tabs Plugin

Using jQuery, CSS and HTML to create a simple tabs plugin that highlights the tab name in red and displays the corresponding div info. 

By adding and removing 'active' classes on the click events target I was able to display the appropriate properties. 

Challenges included using jQuery to manipulate the DOM and selecting the proper targets for adding and removing classes.
